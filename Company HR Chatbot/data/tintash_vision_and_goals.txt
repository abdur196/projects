### Tintash Vision

Mannan has written down the following so that everyone at Tintash understands where the company is coming from and where it is headed. We’d like everyone to understand why Tintash is not just another dev studio, and how our existence fits into the bigger picture — making our daily work more meaningful.

Our teams are skilled at developing products for AR, HealthTech, EdTech, IoT, Blockchain, and Games. 


### Why Does Tintash Exist?

The founders of Tintash moved back to Lahore to be near parents. We had to find work, make a living, and have our impact toward a better world.

We realized that if we’re going to spend nearly half of our waking life at work, then being at work should feel good and we should feel like we’re working with friends.

We wanted to create the opportunities and life we would have had in places like the Bay Area.

Our dream continues to be to make Pakistan a land where great tech companies are built — companies which giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon compete to acquire. And in doing so, massively improve the economic position for the people of Pakistan.

### How? Building the Foundation and Beyond

Building a great company is a team sport.

Tintash is a human-centered and human-relationship based company. Our foundation is built on bringing together, inspiring, and enabling great talent to create teams that want to keep learning and increasing the bar to be the best versions of themselves.

These teams want to work on increasingly important, complex, and interesting problems that make the world a better place.

We understand the importance of a happy inner-work life, and that we are responsible for a healthy inner-work life for those around us.

Tintash is definitely not a political place. That would almost be our worst nightmare. People here are not trying to manipulate the system or each other to succeed.

Remember that most of our negative interactions are good intentions that have been clumsily communicated in a certain context and heard in another context. Nevertheless, we reflect on our negative interactions, and use them as an opportunity to understand one another better and build stronger relationships.

Of course we are not perfect — but we relentlessly pursue being extraordinary. Hence, our work and culture is complex and continuously evolving. To evolve, we must keep learning and experimenting in our processes and organizational structure — keeping what works and improving what doesn’t.

### What? The Five Goals

Each of us is responsible for making Tintash remarkable. For this we need the solid base of strong relationships which take time and effort.

**Goal 1:** Treat one another as friends, care about each person’s inner work life, and strive to make one another successful.

**Goal 2:** Evolve towards a better version of ourselves — individually, as teams, in our processes, and in the quality of our work. Adopt practices like OKRs, CFRs, Scrum, team hangouts, and trainings. Keep experimenting with learning methods, team structures (IoT, EdTech, HealthTech), and teal team models.

**Goal 3:** Find and choose meaningful client projects — projects that help pay salaries and create real-world impact. This means building a strong global brand and presence in North America, Europe, and MENA.

**Goal 4:** Build Tintash’s own products. Aim to spin off 3 major product successes (WhatsApp-scale) by 2030. Learn from past success with top-charting games. Current bet: Get Incredibles. Explore revenue share/equity deals.

**Goal 5:** Provide thought leadership to help increase Pakistan’s software exports. This goal is still in early stages, but we’ve started engaging with local thought leaders.
